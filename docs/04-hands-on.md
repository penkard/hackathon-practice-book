# Chapter 4: Hands-On Project

This is where theory becomes real.  
Build the **smallest working demo** to prove you understand the topic.

Ideas:
- A minimal script  
- A small workflow  
- A micro-app  
- A tiny dataset experiment  
- A simple automation

## Practice: Build a 20-Minute MVP  
Your goal:  
Create *something* that runs, even if it’s ugly.

Rules:
- No polishing  
- No “perfect code” mindset  
- Just ship the smallest usable version  

:::tip Quick Debugging  
When it breaks, ask the RAG bot:  
"Why might this error happen in this context?"  
:::

## Mini Challenge  
Add one extra feature that improves your MVP.  
Even something tiny counts.
