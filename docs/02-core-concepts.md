# Chapter 2: Core Concepts

Let’s break the topic into clear, simple blocks.  
Think of them as LEGO pieces that fit together.

Include:
- Main components  
- Their purpose  
- How they talk to each other  
- A simple analogy

## Practice: Build a Concept Map
Draw a tiny diagram showing the main components and how data flows between them.

Just boxes and arrows.

:::tip Why Draw?
Your brain learns faster when concepts become visual objects.

## Mini Challenge  
Pick any one core concept and explain it using a real life example.

Example format:
