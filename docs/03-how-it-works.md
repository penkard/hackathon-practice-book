# Chapter 3: How It Works

Here we break the system into steps.  
No fancy theory. Just “what happens first, then what, then what”.

You should cover:
- What goes in  
- What happens inside  
- What comes out  
- Which steps usually fail  
- Why those failures happen

## Practice: Write the System Flow  
List the entire flow in bullet points like:

1. User does X  
2. System triggers Y  
3. Process transforms data  
4. Output is generated  
5. Error happens if condition Z occurs
