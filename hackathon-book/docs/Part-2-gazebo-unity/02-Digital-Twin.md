### **3.1 The Digital Twin Philosophy and Sim-to-Real**

The core purpose of the digital twin is to eliminate the distinction between virtual and physical code execution.

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sim-to-Real Fidelity** | The code and algorithms developed in the simulation are expected to run on the real hardware with little to no modification. | **Maximizes Reusability:** Code is written once, tested virtually, and deployed physically. |
| **Accelerated Time** | The simulation can run much faster than real-time (e.g., training a month's worth of experience in one hour). | **Speeds up Training:** Essential for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. |
| **Repeatability** | Any scenario can be reset and run thousands of times with precise initial conditions. | **Reliable Debugging:** Isolating and fixing non-deterministic bugs is simplified. |
